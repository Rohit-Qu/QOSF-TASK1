# QOSF-TASK1
This repo consists of 4 folder :-

1.) ***Task-1.ipynb*** - This folder has a jupyter notebook for the implementation of the task-1 along with the graphs for cost vs no. of iteration for different layers (1-9)

2.) ***Modified Task-1.ipynb***- This folder has same files as the QOSF-TASK1 , but instead of implementing the circuit given in the task , the circuit has been modified by changing RX and RZ gates with RY and RX correspondingly.   

3.)***QOSF_modified_AdagradOptimizer***-  This folder has same files as the QOSF-TASK1 , but instead of implementing the circuit given in the task , the circuit has been modified by changing RX and RZ gates with RY and RX correspondingly and the optimizer used is AdagradOptimizer.   


3.) ***Random target quantum state.ipynb*** - It is the jupyter notebook for preparing the random normalised target state. The target state produced was use throughout every circuit remains same. 

4.) ***RESULT COMPARISON*** - This folder consist of files for comparison of the results obtained by from task1 and task1 modified crcuit.
