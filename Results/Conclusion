In the modified circuit all the RX gates has been rplaced by RY gates while RZ by RX. Following conclusion can be drawn from the plot above:-

1.) For lesser number of layers the modified version of the circuit gives less error and can be preffered over the given circuit in the task.

2.) Also , the optimizer gradient descent seems to be a better option for the task.

3.) For larger number of layers the optimizer does'nt seem to give much advanage rather the curve above seems to be saturating starting from number of layers=5
